# Dalamud Plugins

Add `https://plugins.carvel.li/` to your repository list. 

If you don't know how to do that, that's very unfortunate, and I can't do anything about it.

# Plugin Support

It's unfortunate, but some interactions with other plugin developers really made me dislike
the entire ecosystem. I'm making plugins mostly for myself and a tiny handful of friends; and I
don't actually care much beyond that. I've since moved my repositories elsewhere (git.carvel.li),
as GitHub doesn't allow for a way to disable e.g. pull requests.
